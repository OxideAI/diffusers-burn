# diffusers-burn: A diffusers API in Rust/Burn

> **⚠️ This is still in development - contributors welcome!**

The `diffusers-burn` crate is a conversion of [diffusers-rs](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/diffusers-rs) using [burn](https://github.com/burn-rs/burn) rather than libtorch. This implementation supports Stable Diffusion v1.5, v2.1, as well as Stable Diffusion XL 1.0.
